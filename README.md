# Robots-Market-Analysis

Perform data analysis exploring use patterns of the typical cleaning robot user per country. Include relevant visualizations where appropriate, and address any possible effects of data loss on your findings.

1. Are there geographic differences in robot usage?
  - Consider all descriptive features of a mission, including when and how frequently it occurred.
  - If applicable, comment on how trends in these features might impact design decisions for the hardware, battery, or navigation algorithms of robots sold in different regions.
  
2. Calculate the time between consecutive missions for each robot ("inter-mission interval" or "IMI"). Describe any interesting relationships between IMI and other features of robot behavior.

3. We are aware that data loss exists among the mission records, but are unsure of the cause. Quantify the extent of the loss, differentiating between discrete catastrophic events and random mission loss for individual robots. Investigate whether this loss is uniform or whether it may be impacting other analyses.
